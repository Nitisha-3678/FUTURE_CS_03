# 🔐 FUTURE_CS_03 - Wi-Fi Security Assessment

This repository contains the submission for **Task 3** of the **Future Interns Cyber Security Track**, where the objective was to perform a **Wi-Fi security assessment** of a personal/home network.

---

## 📌 Task Objective

**Conduct a Wi-Fi security assessment** on your home network, checking for:
- Weak passwords
- Open ports
- Unauthorized devices

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- `Nmap` – Network port scanning and service detection  
- Router Admin Panel – To check encryption, WPS, and connected devices  
- Operating System – Kali Linux / Linux / Windows  
- Markdown – For reporting

---

## 📄 Report Overview

- 🔑 Wi-Fi encryption and password strength  
- 🔍 Port scan results and analysis using Nmap  
- 👤 List of authorized vs. suspicious connected devices  
- ⚠️ Identified vulnerabilities  
- ✅ Security improvement recommendations  

---

## 📊 Key Findings

- Router was running an outdated and vulnerable web server (Boa HTTPd).
- Devices on the network were exposing multiple HTTP services unnecessarily.
- WPS was enabled (now disabled).
- Some connected devices were not recognized and were flagged.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Disable unused ports and services.
- Change Wi-Fi password to a strong, secure one.
- Disable WPS permanently.
- Periodically monitor connected devices.
- Update router firmware to patch known vulnerabilities.
